Configuration is set to use postgres database in Docker container. 
Run **postgres:alpine** at **5432 port** and create database with name '**leverxpets**'. 
If you face with problems during connection to the database, 
check that port 5432 is available and no other processes use that port.
Also check that Postgre doesn't work at your machine outside docker container.
